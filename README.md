# Fractal
We have a programming assigment proposed by [Dr Rami Younes](https://met.guc.edu.eg/People/Profile.aspx?facId=3253) to write code(preferably `python`) to generate fractals.

Write your code and make pull request to add it 

make a directory by your name and the python file should be the name of the fractal 

`your-name/fractal-name.py`

your ptoject sturcture should seem like this 
 ```
  ibrahim
    ├── fractal.jpeg
    ├── netwon-fractal.py
    └── requirements.txt
 ```
 The requirements.txt should contaian all the downloaded libraies you have used seperated by new lines
 
 for example 
  ```bash
  > cat requirements.txt
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
```
